## Python -- Week 8

Welcome to Week 8 of my 9-week web development journey – diving deeper into Python with data structures and a mini challenge!

This week's focus was on Python's built-in collections: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets – and ended with a real-world-style coding task where I created a shopping cart app.

## What's Inside:

This folder includes the following Python files:
* `lists.py` — Working with item lists and the `remove()` method
* `lists-2.py` — Additional list operations and testing
* `tuples.py` — Learning how fixed, immutable tuples differ from lists
* `dictionaries.py` — Exploring key-value pairs using `{}` syntax
* `sets.py` — Unique item collections and set methods
* `shopping-cart.py` — A mini-project simulating a grocery cart app

## The Shopping Cart Task

This task challenged me to use **everything I'd learned so far** in Python:
* Continuously accept a product and price from the user
* Give the user a way to exit the input loop
* Display the final list of items and the total cost

I initially struggled with logic structure and loop placement, but I stuck with it. I even went hunting online for examples before finally returning to the tutorial to compare code and understand what I missed.

Interaction: I used the terminal to test and debug the shopping cart and data structure scripts.

## Key Python Concepts Learned

- Lists (`[]`) and how `.remove()` targets only the first matching item
- Tuples (`()`) — similar to lists, but **immutable**
- Dictionaries (`{}`) — key-value storage with fast lookup
- Sets — unordered collections with only unique values
- Practicing control statements inside real scenarios
- Debugging inside the terminal
